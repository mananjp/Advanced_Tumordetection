- Applies data augmentation for robust training
- Trains for 10 epochs with real-time progress monitoring
- Saves the trained model weights as `brain_tumor_resnet18.pth`

**Expected Output**:
```
Epoch 1/10, Loss: 1.2456, Accuracy: 0.4521
Epoch 2/10, Loss: 0.8234, Accuracy: 0.6789
...
Test Accuracy: 0.9234 (1847/2000)
Model weights saved to brain_tumor_resnet18.pth
```

### Making Predictions

Use the trained model to classify new brain MRI images:

```bash
python tumor_test.py
```

**Modify the image path** in `tumor_test.py`:
```python
predict_image("path/to/your/brain_mri_image.png")
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Prediction: glioma
```

### Classification Categories
